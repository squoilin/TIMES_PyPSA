"Variable Name","Likely Unit","Explanation"
"VAR_Act","Activity units (e.g., PJ)","Represents the annual activity level of a technology or process."
"VAR_ActM","Currency/Activity Unit","Guess: Marginal value (dual variable or shadow price) associated with the activity level of a process (VAR_Act). It indicates the change in the objective function for a unit change in the activity."
"VAR_Cap","Capacity units (e.g., MW)","Total installed capacity of a technology or process."
"VAR_Ncap","Capacity units (e.g., MW)","New installed capacity (investment) of a technology in a given period."
"VAR_NcapM","Currency/Capacity Unit","Guess: Marginal value (dual variable) associated with new capacity investment (VAR_Ncap)."
"VAR_FIn","Commodity units (e.g., PJ)","Flow of a commodity (e.g., fuel) into a process."
"VAR_FOut","Commodity units (e.g., PJ)","Flow of a commodity (e.g., electricity, emissions) out of a process."
"VAR_Comnet","Commodity units (e.g., PJ, MtCO2)","Net production of a commodity, typically used for emissions."
"EQ_Combal","Currency/Commodity Unit","Dual variable (shadow price) of the Commodity Balance equation. It represents the marginal cost of supplying one more unit of a commodity."
"EQ_CombalM","Currency/Commodity Unit","Guess: Marginal value associated with the EQ_Combal equation. Could represent the change in the system cost for a change in the commodity price."
"EQ_Cumflo","Currency/Commodity Unit","Dual variable of a Cumulative Flow constraint. Represents the marginal value of relaxing a cumulative resource or emission limit."
"EQ_CumfloM","Currency/Commodity Unit","Guess: Marginal value associated with the EQ_Cumflo equation."
"Cap_New","Capacity units / Currency","Reports details on new capacity investments, such as INSTCAP (Installed Capacity) and LUMPINV (Lump-sum Investment)."
"Cost_Inv","Currency (e.g., MEuro05)","Investment costs for new capacity."
"Cost_Salv","Currency (e.g., MEuro05)","Salvage value of retired capacity at the end of its lifetime."
"Cost_Fom","Currency (e.g., MEuro05)","Fixed Operation and Maintenance costs, independent of the activity level."
"Cost_Act","Currency (e.g., MEuro05)","Costs related to the activity of a process, likely Variable Operation and Maintenance costs."
"Cost_Flo","Currency (e.g., MEuro05)","Costs associated with commodity flows, such as fuel costs or taxes."
"Time_NPV","Dimensionless","Net Present Value (NPV) factor used for discounting future costs to the base year."
"ObjZ","Currency (e.g., MEuro05)","The total value of the objective function, which is typically the total discounted system cost."
"Reg_wobj","Currency (e.g., MEuro05)","Guess: Weighted regional objective function value."
"Reg_obj","Currency (e.g., MEuro05)","Regional objective function value (total cost for the region)."
"Reg_ACost","Currency (e.g., MEuro05)","Annualized regional costs, broken down by type (Investment, Fixed, Variable)."
"User_con","Varies","Value of a user-defined constraint."
